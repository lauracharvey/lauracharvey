# Hi, I'm Laura 👋✨

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/7PTBtf4.png">

If a unicorn is a designer/developer hybrid then I am a “mermaid” - a lady developer with excellent people skills. 

My non-tech roles have allowed me to develop exceptional soft skills and become a superb communicator. I bring passion, determination and kindness to any role I undertake.

I took on a role in DevRel after graduating from General Assembly, it wasn't quite what I expected. I now have an additional 6 months experience as a Full Stack Developer. I am about to take on the biggest job of them all...motherhood. I am therefore looking for a flexible role to allow me the time to care for my little one and develop my skills further. I am open to both freelance and permanent oppotunities.

I enjoy writing and have started a "No Jargon Guide" to support other newbies through subjects I found hard but in very plain English.
