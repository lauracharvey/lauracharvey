# Hi, I'm Laura ðŸ‘‹âœ¨

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/eXPffj1.png">

I am a self taught Front-End Web Developer from the UK. I am currently working on personal projects in HTML, CSS & JavaScript and I am looking to take on client work.

You can see my portfolio here - www.lauracharvey.dev

I also enjoy writing and have started a "No Jargon Guide" to breaking into Web Development. Throughout my learning I found tutorials always seemed to expect prior knowledge, knowledge of Computer Science or just have this element of "stuff" I was expected to know. I really want to help other people get into tech and programming so I have started my guide to help make subjects a little easier. My first post was on Git & GitHub and I am just putting the finishing touches to article 2 which covers Domains and Hosting.
