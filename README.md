# Hi, I'm Laura 👋✨

If a unicorn is a designer/developer hybrid then I am a “mermaid” - a lady developer with excellent people skills. 

My non-tech roles have allowed me to develop exceptional soft skills and become a superb communicator. I bring passion, determination and kindness to any role I undertake.

I took on a role in DevRel after graduating from the Software Engineering Immersive with General Assembly unfortunately it isn't what I expected so I am now looking for a full time development role with mentorship and room to grow. I really love the creativity and visual aspects of Front End and would like the opportunity to explore more about UI/UX.

My favourite things are: programming, being nice to people, dirt bikes, birthday cake and seeing the underdog triumph.

I enjoy writing and have started a "No Jargon Guide" to support other newbies through subjects I found hard but in very plain English.
